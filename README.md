# Library app

From https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript/lessons/library

Using object and object constructor concepts to create a dynamic library app, allowing book objects to be:

- Added to the library
- Deleted from the library
- Modified (namely their 'read' status)

Each book will displayed in a row of an HTML table. A form will allow the user to input book details, which will be passed into a book object and pushed into a library array.

A function will then loop through the array and display each book on the page.
